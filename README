Freecycle is a closed environment due to user privacy reasons. Statistics and the kind of objects that are offered/requested should be not. 

This project makes them available by:
- fetching the email headers from the Freecycle Bucharest via an email address subscribed to the group on Yahoo Groups
- matching the posts according to their subject. The Bucharest groups has a protocol for offering/requireing that is respected by the community. So every post that offers something should have a certain label, and after the object has been donated the offerer should post another message anouncing that, with a specific subject
- showing only the offers / requests that have not been fulfilled yet.

More to come.
