admin:
  make tags joined with category setting
  smarter tags:
    - check for nouns only
    - check for the root of the word - is it a tag or not a tag (put it in a different index?)
    - multiple word tags
    - present first words that appear in more posts (most useful if having many posts)
  search for tags in posts, not for words in tags; performance?
